# NumPy and N Dimensional Arrays

People ask what is a N Dimensional Array...I am people. I am not sure what that is and I have never used NumPy. This project will be my "hello world" journey into NumPy. I have hurd that NumPy is industry standard for engineering and scientific research. I have an ok grip on math. I think I can keep up but I dipped my brain toe into neural networks and the multivariate calculus was an eye opener... to say the least.
